# Anuran Call Recognition
The purpose of this project was to develop a method for accurately recognizing the species of anuran (frog) calls from South America. XGBoost, a gradient boosting tree algorithm, was implemented in R for this task. The study utilized a dataset of audio recordings of anuran calls along with corresponding species labels. After processing the data, XGBoost was trained on the samples and used to make predictions on a separate test set. The results showed a high level of accuracy, with a 97% success rate in species detection. This study demonstrates the efficacy of XGBoost in recognizing species of anuran calls and could have important implications for the study and conservation of amphibian populations in South America.
